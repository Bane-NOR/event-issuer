Webhooks are the foundation for modern API development and is a universal concept that is easily understood by many systems as a way to react to changes.</p> <p>One of the main issues though is contracts, since Event Issuer should handle many different types of events, it is important to use well-defined schemas/contracts that can be used for validation. For this, the Event Issuer can be used to get registered schemas for different events that can be subscribed to.</p>"},{"location":"#what-are-webhooks","title":"What are Webhooks?","text":"<p>Webhooks are how one system notifies another system of a state change.</p> <p>In architectural terms, a webhook is a programming language agnostic approach for sending messages between distributed systems. The power of webhooks comes first from being independent of any specific tech stack and second from the notification-based approach. Regardless of your architecture, your systems can receive or broadcast webhooks without being dependent on a specific vendor or even on the same network. Further, downstream systems receiving webhooks don't need to poll a central system for updates or status changes, they can simply listen for an event and process the results.</p> <p>In practical terms, a webhook is simply an HTTP request - usually a POST - with a JSON payload or parameters broadcast from the central system. Much of the modern web is built on this distributed communication pattern.</p>"},{"location":"#producing","title":"Producing","text":"<p>To produce events to Bane NOR the Event Issuer will have endpoints that can be used to send new events.
