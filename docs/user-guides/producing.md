# Producing
(For concrete examples, check out our [bruno collection](https://github.com/Bane-NOR/event-issuer/tree/main/bruno))

Event Issuer can be used to produce new events into Bane NOR. This is not openly available and an agreement with Bane NOR is needed to be able to produce data. The correct access rights for producing will be given on an agreement basis.

Bane NOR uses the [Cloud Event](https://cloudevents.io/) specification for producing events and supports producing both single events and the possibility of sending batches of events.

Cloud Events has created SDKs for different languages that can be found on the main page under the `SDKs` in the menu.

The Event Issuer has two API endpoints for this:

- {tenantId}/produce
- {tenantId}/produce/batch

## Production modes

As mentioned, Event Issuer supports multiple methods for producing data into Bane NOR, both single events and batches. Including this, Event Issuer also supports two different Cloud Event structures, Binary and Structured mode showcased in the chapters below.

At the moment only data produced with the JSON format is supported, but other content types can be added later based on user needs.

### Binary

In binary mode, the `cloud event` headers are sent as part of the HTTP header values by using the `ce-` prefix. For more information about this see the [binary mode](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/bindings/http-protocol-binding.md#31-binary-content-mode) documented in the specification.

```http
POST event-issuer/v1/{tenantId}/produce HTTP/1.1
Host: api.banenor.com
ce-specversion: 1.0
ce-type: cloud.domain.sub-domain.event.v1
ce-time: 2018-04-05T03:56:24Z
ce-id: 1234-1234-1234
ce-source: /mycontext/subcontext
 .... further attributes ...
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: nnnn

{
 ... application data ...
}
```

### Structured

With structured mode, the `cloud event` headers are sent as part of the HTTP payload/body data. For more information about this see the [structured mode](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/bindings/http-protocol-binding.md#32-structured-content-mode) documented in the specification.

```http

POST event-issuer/v1/{tenantId}/produce HTTP/1.1
Host: api.banenor.com
Content-Type: application/cloudevents+json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: nnnn

{
 "specversion" : "1.0",
 "type" : "cloud.domain.sub-domain.event.v1",

 ... further attributes omitted ...

 "data" : {
 ... application data ...
 }
}
```

### Batch

With batch mode, a list of cloud events can be sent in one HTTP request to reduce the amount of required API calls. The example showcased here applies structured mode:

```http
POST event-issuer/v1/{tenantId}/produce/batch HTTP/1.1
Host: api.banenor.com
Content-Type: application/cloudevents-batch+json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: nnnn

[
 {
 "specversion" : "1.0",
 "type" : "cloud.domain.sub-domain.event.v1",

 ... further attributes omitted ...

 "data" : {
 ... application data ...
 }
 },
 {
 "specversion" : "1.0",
 "type" : "cloud.domain.sub-domain.event.v2",

 ... further attributes omitted ...

 "data" : {
 ... application data ...
 }
 }
]
```
