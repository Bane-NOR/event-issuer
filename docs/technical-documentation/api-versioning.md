# API Versioning

## API versions

### Version URL

This API uses semver, and version names follows the `v{major}` format. You can find the versions currently available by using the version selector at the top of this page.

### Beta versions

The beta versions provide a preview of what the stable version will look like in the future. Beta versions contain functionality that is reasonably mature, and highly likely to become a part of the stable API.

Beta versions are indicated by a `beta` suffix after the version.

### Alpha versions

Alpha versions contain functionality that is new and experimental, and not guaranteed to ever become a part of the stable API. This functionality presents no guarantee of service, so its use is subject to caution.

Alpha versions are indicated by an `alpha` suffix after the version name.
