{"openapi":"3.1.0","externalDocs":{"description":"Find more information on the API in the github documentation.","url":"https://bane-nor.github.io/event-issuer/"},"info":{"title":"Event Issuer Alpha","version":"0.3.1","license":{"name":"EUPL-1.2","url":"https://eupl.eu/1.2/en/"},"description":"### Introduction\n\nThe goal of an Event Issuer is to provide an infrastructure to abstract event delivery via a secured RESTful API to\nexternal users and systems such as SaaS. This allows external users to maintain service boundaries, and not directly depend\non any specific message broker technology. The event issuer will have the possibility for both consuming events from\nBane NOR and produce new events.\n\n### API versions\n\nThis API uses sematic versioning, and version names follow the v{major} format. You can find the versions currently available\nby using the version selector at the top of this page. To use a specific API version, you can pass the version as part of the request URI.\n\n#### Beta version\n\nThe beta versions provide a preview of what the stable version will look like in the future. Beta versions contain functionality that is reasonably mature, and highly likely to become a part of the stable API.\n\nBeta versions are indicated by a beta suffix after the version. For example, the beta version header for the v1 version is then v1beta.\n\n#### Alpha version\n\nAlpha versions contain functionality that is new and experimental, and not guaranteed to ever become a part of the stable API. This functionality presents no guarantee of service, so its use is subject to caution.\n\nAlpha versions are indicated by an alpha suffix after the version name. For example, the alpha version header for the v1 version is then v1alpha.\n\n---\n"},"paths":{"/{tenantId}/subscriptions":{"get":{"summary":"List all subscriptions you have created","operationId":"getAllSubscriptions","tags":["Subscriptions"],"parameters":[{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/tenantId"}],"responses":{"200":{"description":"Ok","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"type":"array","items":{"allOf":[{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/subscription"}]}}}}},"400":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/400-bad-request"},"401":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/401-unauthorized"},"403":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/403-forbidden"},"404":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/404-not-found"},"500":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/500-internal-server-error"}}},"post":{"summary":"Create a new subscription","operationId":"createSubscription","tags":["Subscriptions"],"parameters":[{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/tenantId"}],"requestBody":{"description":"A Json Object containing subscription info","required":true,"content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/createSubscription"}}}},"responses":{"200":{"description":"Ok","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/subscription"}}}},"400":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/400-bad-request"},"401":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/401-unauthorized"},"409":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/409-conflict"},"500":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/500-internal-server-error"}}}},"/{tenantId}/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}":{"get":{"summary":"Get information on specific subscription with more details","operationId":"getSpecificSubscription","tags":["Subscriptions"],"parameters":[{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/tenantId"},{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/subscriptionId"}],"responses":{"200":{"description":"Ok","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/subscription"}}}},"400":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/400-bad-request"},"401":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/401-unauthorized"},"403":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/403-forbidden"},"404":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/404-not-found"},"500":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/500-internal-server-error"}}},"put":{"summary":"Update a specific subscription with new information","operationId":"updateSpecificSubscription","tags":["Subscriptions"],"parameters":[{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/tenantId"},{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/subscriptionId"}],"requestBody":{"description":"A Json Object containing subscription information.","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/updateSubscription"}}}},"responses":{"200":{"description":"Ok","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/subscription"}}}},"400":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/400-bad-request"},"401":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/401-unauthorized"},"403":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/403-forbidden"},"404":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/404-not-found"},"500":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/500-internal-server-error"}}},"delete":{"summary":"Delete an existing subscription","operationId":"deleteSpecificSubscription","tags":["Subscriptions"],"parameters":[{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/tenantId"},{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/subscriptionId"}],"responses":{"200":{"description":"Ok"},"400":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/400-bad-request"},"401":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/401-unauthorized"},"403":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/403-forbidden"},"404":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/404-not-found"},"422":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/422-unprocessable-content"},"500":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/500-internal-server-error"}}}},"/{tenantId}/produce":{"post":{"summary":"Produce events to the event backbone","operationId":"produce","tags":["Produce"],"parameters":[{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/tenantId"}],"requestBody":{"description":"A CloudEvent based JSON Object containing metadata and the payload","required":true,"content":{"application/cloudevents+json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/cloudevents"}}}},"responses":{"200":{"description":"Ok -
